# The Verilog-A code generator

##  Usage

1. modify the args in the main.py
2. `python main.py`

## Description

The codes are used to generate the VerilogA code which can be directly used in the `spectre simulation` .

The generated VerilogA code's fuction is to generate the specific waveforms according to your setting.

And the setting is done in the python code (`main.py`), which will facilitate greatly the coding works.
